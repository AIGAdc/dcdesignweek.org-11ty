sectionOneBody: >-
  If you don’t already know us, DC Design Week (DCDW) is an annual celebration of DC’s creative community: An ever-growing body of professionals, makers, and voices working across design disciplines.


  **This year’s theme is: Community Recovery & Wellbeing.** You’ll see community-based healing and wellness woven into this year’s events and branding. While the DC Design Week committee plans some of your favorite annual events (including keynotes, parties, and more), we’re excited to use our community-curated event model again. For the second year in a row, most DCDW events will be proposed and hosted by you, our community!


  Find more details on what we’re looking for below. You can also join us for an **information session on May 25, 2022**, to learn more about [submitting an event.](#)

sectionThreeHeader: The pandemic still isn’t over. What is DC Design Week’s stance on including in-person events?
sectionThreeBody: >- 
  COVID-19 is a rapidly changing, ongoing pandemic. The wide distribution of vaccines in DC and across the nation makes us hopeful that we can bring back more in-person event experiences to DCDW 2022..
  We plan to host a few small, in-person, indoor events (less than 20 attendees with masks) and a few, larger, in-person, outdoor events for DC Design Week 2022, from October 14–21.
  That said, DC Design Week will always follow the latest CDC guidance on hosting in-person gatherings. As a result, we might pivot events to virtual experiences if the situation changes. Prospective event partners must understand this when proposing in-person events. We will work with selected event partners to ensure that each in-person event follows the latest CDC guidelines and has appropriate contingency plans.
