  questions:
    - question: Consignment with Terratorie Maps + Goods
      answer: >-
        If you have a small amount of merchandise to sell and would prefer someone else handle the transactions, this is the right fit for you. Items will be sold on consignment and anything unsold will be returned to the artist. Makers keep 60% of sales price. Items on consignment will be allowed a max of 3 SKUs, with 6 items per SKU. Exceptions can be made if the items sold are small in size (i.e. stickers, magnets, buttons, etc).

    - question:  Hosted by a Brookland Arts Walk Studio
      answer: >-
        If you're interested in displaying more of your work AND can handle your own transactions (e.g. have your own Square, etc.), look no further. We'll be pairing makers up with the different studios on the Arts Walk for the Block Party. There will be both indoor spaces in the studios and outdoor spaces with tables to sell your work.

    If you donâ€™t already know us, **DC Design Week (DCDW) is an annual
    celebration** of DCâ€™s creative community: An ever-growing body of
    professionals, makers, and voices working across design disciplines. 


    **This yearâ€™s theme is: Community Recovery & Wellbeing.** Youâ€™ll see community-based healing and wellness woven into this yearâ€™s events and branding. While the DC Design Week committee plans some of your favorite annual events (including keynotes, parties, and more), weâ€™re excited to use our community-curated event model again. For the second year in a row, most DCDW events will be **proposed and hosted by you, our community!**
  sectionOneHeader: What is DC Design Week?
  questions:
    - question: What is DC Design Weekâ€™s stance on including in-person events?
      answer: >-
        COVID-19 is a rapidly changing, ongoing pandemic. The wide distribution
        of vaccines in DC and across the nation makes us hopeful that we can
        bring back more in-person event experiences to DCDW 2022.


        We plan to host **a few small, in-person, indoor events** (less than 20 attendees with masks) and **a few, larger, in-person, outdoor events** for DC Design Week 2022, from October 14â€“21.


        That said, **DC Design Week will always follow** the latest CDC guidance on hosting in-person gatherings. As a result, we might pivot events to virtual experiences if the situation changes. Prospective event partners must understand this when proposing in-person events. We will work with selected event partners to ensure that each in-person event follows the latest CDC guidelines and has appropriate contingency plans.

      trigger: question-1
    - question: How does event ticketing and pricing work?
      answer: >-
        DCDW charges for most of its events via Eventbrite to pay for overhead
        costs not covered by sponsorships. Once the majority of events are
        locked in, we will set prices with equity, accessibility, and inclusion
        in mind. We are a 100% volunteer-run committee and aim to break even
        with all of our events. Any profit is automatically routed to AIGA DCâ€™s
        [Design Continuum Fund](https://www.givecontinuum.org/) (DCF). This fund
        provides scholarships to under-represented students in the DC, MD, and
        VA area who aspire to have future careers in design.




        If youâ€™re interested in sponsoring DCDW, which will help offset ticket fees, make events more accessible, and offer other benefits to all attendees, email [designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org). All sponsors receive benefits and shoutouts in exchange for your support!




        In an effort to seek equity, speakers for an event can request to keep a portion of the eventâ€™s profits. Our volunteer team calculates respective event profits after DCDW takes place. Keep in mind that this is a nominal amount and not a true reflection of the speakerâ€™s value or worth. We can give estimates upon request.

  sectionThreeHeader: How does the community-curated event proposal process work?
  sectionThreeBody: >-
    In our community-curated events model, we invite you, the community, to
    pitch and put on your own events. **Event proposals were due by June 19,
    2022**.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 


    The DCDW committee will review proposals and add events to the DCDW calendar based on their quality, attention to detail, and adherence to [DC Design Weekâ€™s Code of Conduct](https://dc.aiga.org/events/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=AIGA%20DC%20is%20dedicated%20to,%2C%20religion%2C%20or%20political%20affiliation.). All events should provide value for the DC creative community by being relevant, engaging, accessible, and inclusive.Â 


    **We will contact everyone who submits a proposal to share our decisions and any next steps by July 20, 2022.**
  questions:
    - question: What happens after submitting an event proposal?
      answer: >-
        **If your event is selected**, it will become an event on the DC Design
        Week 2022 calendar. **Congrats!** ðŸŽ‰Â 


        **We may work with you to refine some big picture event details**, such as the eventâ€™s overall goals, your intended audiences, etc. We may also work with you to understand more about what you need from us. This will help everyone meet our mutual goals in planning and hosting a fabulous event.


        * **What you get from us:**

          * Inclusion of your event as part of the official DC Design Week 2022 schedule and you (or your organization) listed as a partner.Â 
          * Promotion of your event as part of DCDW across our communication channels, which may include:Â 

            * Shoutouts on our social media channels

          * A DCDW **Event Lead (volunteer) to support you** with event planning, logistics, and marketing.Â 

            * While our volunteers will offer support, you will own your eventâ€™s planning and execution. We expect you to meet us halfway in marketing your event through your own communications channels. Your DCDW event lead can work with you on the most effective ways to do this.
          * Event **registration administration** via Eventbrite.
          * Event **accessibility support in compliance with ADA guidelines**. (e.g., closed captioning, verbit.)

          * Access to additional volunteer support (week-of or day-of the event) as needed.
        * **What we get from you:**

          * Commitment to hosting your event during DC Design Week 2022. We understand that life happens, but if youâ€™re submitting an event proposal, it means that youâ€™re committed to making this event happen against most odds.Â 
          * Agreement to follow [the Terms & Conditions](https://dc.aiga.org/programs-initiatives/dc-design-week/event-partner-terms-conditions/.) of proposing and holding an event for DC Design Week 2022.
          * Commitment to our [Code of Conduct](https://dc.aiga.org/events/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=AIGA%20DC%20is%20dedicated%20to,%2C%20religion%2C%20or%20political%20affiliation.).
          * Commitment to your event idea. We know that ideas and plans change, but DCDW selects events with our full week of programming in mind. We hope you understand that in order to ensure weâ€™re offering a diverse range of events to our community, we will expect the eventâ€™s overall approach and scope to stay consistent.

  sectionFourHeader: How else can I get involved with DC Design Week 2022?
  sectionFourBody: DC Design Week is 100% volunteer-run, and it wouldnâ€™t be the
    same without the support of our community. We are always looking for
    sponsors who can help ensure this week is as accessible and inclusive as
    possible, as well as  volunteers who can provide support during DC Design
    Week.
