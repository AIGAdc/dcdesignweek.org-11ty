sectionThreeHeader: The pandemic still isn’t over. What is DC Design Week’s stance on including in-person events?
sectionThreeBody: >- 
  COVID-19 is a rapidly changing, ongoing pandemic. The wide distribution of vaccines in DC and across the nation makes us hopeful that we can bring back more in-person event experiences to DCDW 2022..
  We plan to host a few small, in-person, indoor events (less than 20 attendees with masks) and a few, larger, in-person, outdoor events for DC Design Week 2022, from October 14–21.
  That said, DC Design Week will always follow the latest CDC guidance on hosting in-person gatherings. As a result, we might pivot events to virtual experiences if the situation changes. Prospective event partners must understand this when proposing in-person events. We will work with selected event partners to ensure that each in-person event follows the latest CDC guidelines and has appropriate contingency plans.
