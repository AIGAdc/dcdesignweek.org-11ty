    If you don’t already know us, DC Design Week (DCDW) is an annual celebration
    of DC’s creative community: An ever-growing body of professionals, makers,
    and voices working across design disciplines. 




    This year’s theme is: Community Recovery & Wellbeing. You’ll see community-based healing and wellness woven into this year’s events and branding.




    While the DC Design Week committee plans some of your favorite annual events (including keynotes, parties, and more), we’re excited to use our community-curated event model again. For the second year in a row, most DCDW events will be proposed and hosted by you, our community!




    Find more details on what we’re looking for below. You can also view the recording of our information session to learn more about [submitting an event](https://forms.gle/qBjZeX3JVKihfatY9).
  sectionOneHeader: What is DC Design Week?
  questions:
    - question: What is DC Design Week’s stance on including in-person events?
      answer: >-
        COVID-19 is a rapidly changing, ongoing pandemic. The wide distribution
        of vaccines in DC and across the nation makes us hopeful that we can
        bring back more in-person event experiences to DCDW 2022.


        We plan to host **a few small, in-person, indoor events** (less than 20 attendees with masks) and **a few, larger, in-person, outdoor events** for DC Design Week 2022, from October 14–21.


        That said, **DC Design Week will always follow** the latest CDC guidance on hosting in-person gatherings. As a result, we might pivot events to virtual experiences if the situation changes. Prospective event partners must understand this when proposing in-person events. We will work with selected event partners to ensure that each in-person event follows the latest CDC guidelines and has appropriate contingency plans.

      trigger: question-1
    - question: How does event ticketing and pricing work?
      answer: >-
        DCDW charges for most of its events via Eventbrite to pay for overhead
        costs not covered by sponsorships. Once the majority of events are
        locked in, we will set prices with equity, accessibility, and inclusion
        in mind. We are a 100% volunteer-run committee and aim to break even
        with all of our events. Any profit is automatically routed to AIGA DC’s
        [Design Continuum Fund](https://www.givecontinuum.org/) (DCF). This fund
        provides scholarships to under-represented students in the DC, MD, and
        VA area who aspire to have future careers in design.




        If you’re interested in sponsoring DCDW, which will help offset ticket fees, make events more accessible, and offer other benefits to all attendees, email [designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org). All sponsors receive benefits and shoutouts in exchange for your support!




        In an effort to seek equity, speakers for an event can request to keep a portion of the event’s profits. Our volunteer team calculates respective event profits after DCDW takes place. Keep in mind that this is a nominal amount and not a true reflection of the speaker’s value or worth. We can give estimates upon request.

  sectionTwoHeader: What is DC Design Week looking for in an event?
  sectionTwoBody: >-
    We’ll review event proposals based on their quality, attention to detail,
    and adherence to [DC Design Week’s Code of
    Conduct](https://dc.aiga.org/events/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=AIGA%20DC%20is%20dedicated%20to,%2C%20religion%2C%20or%20political%20affiliation.).
    This criteria helps us offer community-curated events that reflect our
    community’s diverse interests, values, and needs. All events that we host
    should be relevant, engaging, and provide value for the DC design community.
