  body: The DC, Maryland, and Virginia area has a proud design community, and this
    year we’ll be emphasizing the word “community” more than ever. You’ll see
    events rooted in connection, recovery, and curiosity—with an eye toward
    what’s worked in the past and how we might support our larger ecosystem as
    we move forward.
