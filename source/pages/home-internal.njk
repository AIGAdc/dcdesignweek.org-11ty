sectionOneHeader: What is DC Design Week?
sectionOneBody: >-
  If you donâ€™t already know us, **DC Design Week (DCDW) is an annual celebration** of DCâ€™s creative community: An ever-growing body of professionals, makers, and voices working across design disciplines. 


  **This yearâ€™s theme is: Community Recovery & Wellbeing.** Youâ€™ll see community-based healing and wellness woven into this yearâ€™s events and branding. While the DC Design Week committee plans some of your favorite annual events (including keynotes, parties, and more), weâ€™re excited to use our community-curated event model again. For the second year in a row, most DCDW events will be **proposed and hosted by you, our community!**


  Find more details on what weâ€™re looking for below. You can also [view the recording of our information session](#) to learn more about [submitting an event](#).

sectionOneQuestions:
  - question: What is DC Design Weekâ€™s stance on including in-person events?
    answer: >-
      COVID-19 is a rapidly changing, ongoing pandemic. The wide distribution of vaccines in DC and across the nation makes us hopeful that we can bring back more in-person event experiences to DCDW 2022.


      **We plan to host a few small, in-person, indoor events (less than 20 attendees with masks) and a few, larger, in-person, outdoor events for DC Design Week 2022, from October 14â€“21.**


      That said, **DC Design Week will always follow** [the latest CDC guidance on hosting in-person gatherings.](#) As a result, we might pivot events to virtual experiences if the situation changes. Prospective event partners must understand this when proposing in-person events. We will work with selected event partners to ensure that each in-person event follows the latest CDC guidelines and has appropriate contingency plans.
