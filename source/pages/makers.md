  questions:
    - question: Consignment with Terratorie Maps + Goods
      answer: >-
        If you have a small amount of merchandise to sell (max 3 SKUs, with 6 items per SKU) and would prefer someone else handles the transactions, this is the right fit for you. Items will be sold on consignment, and anything unsold will be returned to you. Makers keep 60% of sale price.

      trigger: question-1
    - question:  Hosted by a Brookland Arts Walk Studio
      answer: >-
        If you're interested in displaying more of your work AND can handle your own transactions (e.g. have your own Square, etc.), look no further. We'll be pairing makers up with the 27 different studios on the Arts Walk for the Block Party. There will be both indoor spaces in the studios and outdoor spaces with tables to sell your work.

  sectionFourHeader: How else can I get involved with DC Design Week 2022?
  sectionFourBody: DC Design Week is 100% volunteer-run, and it wouldnâ€™t be the
    same without the support of our community. We are always looking for
    sponsors who can help ensure this week is as accessible and inclusive as
    possible, as well as  volunteers who can provide support during DC Design
    Week.
