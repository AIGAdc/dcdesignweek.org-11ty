description: "The DCDW Pop-Up Shop is back! We’ll be doing things a little differently: a 1-evening Pop-Up Block Party on Friday, October 8, 6–10 pm, in a new location — the beautiful Brookland Arts Walk — which has a lot more space. Are you a local maker with merch to sell? Submit an application form by Wednesday, September 1."
