description: "DC Design Week (DCDW) is an annual celebration of DC’s creative community: an ever-growing body of professionals, makers, and voices working across disciplines. We aspire to foster conversations that will challenge, excite, and promote change. This year, we’re shifting our focus to feature events curated and hosted by our community. Local makers can expect our vision for the future to be pluralistic and our art and design practices to contain a multitude of perspectives and experiences."
