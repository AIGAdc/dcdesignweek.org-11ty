  - header: About DC Design Week
    body: "DC Design Week (DCDW) is an annual celebration of the DC, Maryland, and Virginia regionâ€™s creative communityâ€”an ever-growing body of professionals, makers, and voices working across design disciplines. Each year, a committee of volunteers led by AIGA DC Board Members collaborates with local designers, businesses, and organizations to host a variety of events showcasing the work, creativity, and relationships thriving in this area. 
    
    
    Given the uncertainty of the last two years, our 2022 themes are resilience and the power of community. Together over the course of eight days, weâ€™ll nurture curiosity and connections through more than 15 creative events, including sessions led by renowned design agencies, workshops with local makers, and restorative gatherings to keep you centered."
