questions:
  - question: How can I participate in DC Design Week?
    answer: >-
      This year, we’ll be offering virtual, hybrid, and in-person programming. Most virtual events will be held via Zoom. Hybrid events will offer opportunities to attend in person or virtually via Zoom. All in-person events will follow CDC-recommended guidelines as well as any additional safety protocol from our partners and venues. Please check the event listing for event-specific details.


      For virtual events, we strongly recommend you join your Zoom session via your computer so you can easily view the presenter and any visuals they may share. Download the Zoom app ahead of time so you don’t miss a minute. You can also join through your browser.

  - question: How is DCDW partnering with the community for event programming?
    answer: >-
      In our community-curated events model, which we started last year, we invited our community to pitch and put on their own events. We reviewed event proposals from individuals, groups, and organizations to pick diverse, thought-provoking, engaging events that represent the DC creative community. 


      Once chosen, event planners from the community were partnered with members of our committee to plan the events that will take place in October.

  - question: How do I find the Zoom link for the event?
    answer: >-
      Once you’ve registered for your event through Eventbrite, you will receive
      an email from DC Design Week via Eventbrite with a link to the Zoom. You
      will receive the link again shortly before the event starts so it’s at the
      top of your inbox.


      If you have any trouble finding the Zoom link for the event, please contact us at [dcdw@dc.aiga.org](mailto:dcdw@dc.aiga.org) in the hour leading up to the start time.

  - question: I’m in a waiting room. How do I get in?
    answer: >-
      We want to create a more intimate space for conversations, ensuring only
      those who register for the event can join.


      Make sure your full name on Zoom matches your registration name by hovering over your name in the participant list, selecting “More,” “Rename.” If you have dialed in by phone, please [send us an email at designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga) immediately with your event name and phone number in the subject line.


      We will send reminders as people join the waiting room and will only admit those whose display name matches our registration list.

  - question: I’m having trouble with my Zoom. What can I do?
    answer: "We encourage you to [explore Zoom’s Help
      Center](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206175806) first. If you
      aren’t able to resolve the issue that way, [reach out to

  - question: What’s your refund policy?
    answer: >-
      We will honor refunds up until 24 hours before your event’s start time. 


      We will **not** honor refunds:

      - For technical difficulties unless you [reach out to us](mailto:dcdw@dc.aiga.org) at the **start of the event** to see if we can help troubleshoot your issue. (We’ll likely ask to see what steps from Zoom’s guide you’ve tried to start.)

      - If you aren’t admitted from the waiting room because your display name did not match our registration list.

  - question:
      "COVID-19 is rapidly changing: What happens if in-person events need
      to be cancelled?"
    answer: When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom and a refund
      should not be expected. If an event is canceled in its entirety a refund
      will be issued. In either scenario you will be notified immediately.

  - question: What is the mask policy for in-person events?
    answer: Event partners who are putting on each individual event will have the final say, but we are encouraging those not speaking, drinking, or eating to wear a mask. When in doubt, review the information on the webpage for your event for more specific requirements.
    trigger: question-9
    expanded: false
  - question: Will events be recorded?
    answer: >-
      All virtual and hybrid events will be recorded unless technical issues
      occur or recording the content disrupts the intimacy and privacy required
      for an event. The [recordings will be shared in the AIGA DC recordings
      archive](https://dc.aiga.org/introducing-the-aiga-dc-event-recordings-archive/)
      for AIGA members to rewatch or catch up on at a later date. 


      If you’re not an AIGA member, you can [register for a membership](https://dc.aiga.org/membership/membership-rates/) on the AIGA Membership website. We’re a 100% non-profit entity, so this goes a long way to keeping us afloat.

  - question: How can I buy tickets for multiple people in my organization at one time, instead of having to purchase each ticket separately?

  - question: When I buy a ticket, where is the money going?
    answer: >-
      Ticket sales cover our expenses, including streaming platforms and live closed captioning. We also share revenue with our speakers when requested to ensure our speakers receive some compensation for bringing their talent, expertise, and time to our community.


      DC Design Week donates all profit from the week’s events to the [Design Continuum Fund](https://www.givecontinuum.org/), which helps launch the next generation of talented artists and designers by offering financial support for minority and economically disadvantaged students.


      We try to make our programming as affordable as possible, and therefore accessible, to all. If you ever find that costs bar you from participating, please [reach out to us at designweek@dc.aiga.org](mailto:designweek@dc.aiga.org) so we can work together to find a solution that works for you!
