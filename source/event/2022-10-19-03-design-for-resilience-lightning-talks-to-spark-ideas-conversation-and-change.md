    ## Description and details


    Service Design DC is back for the third year of its popular DC Design Week lightning talks! Join us for a series of cross-disciplinary, rapid-fire presentations that will showcase unique perspectives on the notion of resilience — and how design inherently fosters quicker, more successful recovery from adversity for individuals and communities. 




    Our speakers will regale us with case studies, methods, frameworks, and philosophies that we’re sure will inspire new ideas and ways of thinking about your own work. As always, there will be ample time for Q&A and discussion.


    Service Design DC is the home base of the Service Design Network DC chapter, with more than 1,500 designers and design leaders dedicated to advancing the practice of service design and empowering each other  through learning, connection, and inspiration. Join us at [meetup.com/ServiceDesignDC](http://meetup.com/ServiceDesignDC).


    *This event was put together in partnership with [Service Design DC](https://www.meetup.com/ServiceDesignDC/).*
