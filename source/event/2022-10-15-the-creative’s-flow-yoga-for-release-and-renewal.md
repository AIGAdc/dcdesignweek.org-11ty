    ## Description and Details


    Join Shakeelah Sutton, yoga teacher and founder of the calm/cool collective, in co-creating a yoga and relaxation experience designed to meet your specific needs in the moment. 


    We’ll start with a body mapping exercise to identify areas of tension, which will then be used to create a yoga flow that addresses everyone’s individual and collective need for release and relaxation.


    Through the artful blend of slow movement, meditative stillness, and intentional breathing, you can expect to leave feeling deeply restored with a greater sense of awareness, clarity, and creativity. 


    All experience levels are welcomed. Light refreshments will be provided.


    Photographers and/or videographers will be documenting the event. If you wish to opt-out of being photographed, please notify the event organizers upon check-in.


    *Please note: In alignment with our mission of providing historically underrepresented communities with access to holistic wellness, this event creates space for those who identify as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color). While we will never deny anyone access to our event, if you do not identify as BIPOC, we kindly ask that you save space for those who are.*
