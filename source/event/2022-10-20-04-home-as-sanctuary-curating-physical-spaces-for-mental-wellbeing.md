  ### COVID-19 is hard to predict: What happens if in-person events need to be canceled?


  When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom and a refund should not be expected. If an event is canceled in its entirety, a refund will be issued. In either scenario you will be notified immediately.




  ## How to prepare


  * To prepare for the workshop, take pictures of your home to use as a visual prompt during the breakout group activity.
