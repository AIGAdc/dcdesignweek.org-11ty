    ## Description and details


    Join the DC Public Library and the design team behind the community-centered permanent exhibit installed as a part of the modernization of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library.


    Learn how deep design research with long-time residents, local creatives, and teens informed design concepts prototyped with people  in all four quadrants of DC at various neighborhood library branches, and how this prototyping led to the now completed program. Explore how community interactions were developed, tested, and are now live as residents engage with an exhibits program that is resonant, vibrant, and unambiguously community-driven.


    After a talk featuring the design process, participants are invited to explore the exhibit itself.

  ## Preparation


  We recommend that attendees wear masks when not eating or drinking.


  ### COVID-19 is hard to predict: What happens if in-person events need to be canceled?


  When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom and a refund should not be expected. If an event is canceled in its entirety, a refund will be issued. In either scenario you will be notified immediately.
