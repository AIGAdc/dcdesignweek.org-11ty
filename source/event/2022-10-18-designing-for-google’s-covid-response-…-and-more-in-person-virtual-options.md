    ## Description and Details


    Google responds to crises around the world daily — so how did the team bring years of experimentation and research to design public-facing tools for the biggest crisis of our lifetimes, COVID-19? 

    Google Social Search Lead UX designer Liora Yuklea will share her team’s work on efforts to fight misinformation with the high-traffic Covid Organized Search Results Page.

    Plus, get to know the UX designers and researchers newly working on Google Chrome, News, and Search in our DC office. 



    You'll learn about Google Design's culture and processes and how they differ from product to product. We’ll discuss the common thread that unites our work: designing responsibly at scale for a global audience. We’ll also share some best practices for collaborating across time zones and how we're adapting to hybrid work.



    **This event has two ways to participate: in-person attendance or via Google Meet. You will indicate the way you plan to participate when selecting your ticket type.**



    In-person attendees: As you enjoy a pastry and coffee, you will have plenty of time for conversation, questions, and networking. Please arrive early to settle in.
