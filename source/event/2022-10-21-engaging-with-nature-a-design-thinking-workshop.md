    Over the last two years, as people were forced more than ever before to
    retreat from community spaces and onto computers, they began searching for
    new ways to engage safely with the world beyond screens. Through this
    rewriting of spacial engagement, many found solace and inspiration in the
    beauty  and peace of the natural world. From evening walks to backyard
    birding to camping, fishing and hiking, engagement with the outdoors has
    reached new heights. 




    While biomimicry has long inspired designers to look to their environments for inspiration, how can we as designers intentionally build space to allow ourselves to engage with the natural world? 




    In this workshop, we will talk through the concept of biomimicry and how to make intentional time for things like forest bathing (even if you live in a city). We will then put those concepts into practice by participating in exercises that employ nature-inspired design thinking. 




    Bonus! Every person at the workshop will receive a specially-designed, interactive zine to further inspire their biomimicry skills.




    Light refreshments will be provided.
