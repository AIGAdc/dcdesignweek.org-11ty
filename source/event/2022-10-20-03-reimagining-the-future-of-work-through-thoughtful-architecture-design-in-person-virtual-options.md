    ## Description and details


    Morning Consult’s new offices were designed to work in harmony with the company’s innovative hybrid work model. They set out to make their offices as flexible as home — while making remote workers an inclusive part of office culture.

    Join Jeighdeane King (Associate Vice President, Head of Spaces & Facilities, Morning Consult), Vince Wanga (Vice President, Head of Creative, Morning Consult), and Jessica Maples (SE Tech Practice Leader, Gensler) in an informative and engaging conversation on the future of work.

    Learn how Morning Consult leveraged thoughtful architecture and design to allow team members maximum flexibility on where and how they work through embedded flexible seating, an intentional lack of formal offices, private locker systems, technology-enabled collaborative spaces, hospitality-inspired wayfinding, a clean desk policy, and a plethora of open and private workspaces. This may change how offices function in the future.

    Light refreshments will be provided for in-person attendees.

    This event has two ways to participate: in-person attendance or via Zoom. You will indicate the way you plan to participate when selecting your ticket.

    T﻿his event was put together in partnership with [Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com/).
