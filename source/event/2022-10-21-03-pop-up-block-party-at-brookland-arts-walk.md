  ## In-Person Guidance


  We recommend that everyone wear a mask when they aren’t eating or drinking.


  ### COVID-19 is hard to predict: What happens if in-person events need to be canceled?


  When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom and a refund should not be expected. If an event is canceled in its entirety, a refund will be issued. In either scenario you will be notified immediately.


  ## How to prepare


  * Bring your sketchbook, a blank cotton t-shirt, or a tote bag to make a fun DCDW custom block print with [The Block Print Bike](https://blockprintbike.com/).
