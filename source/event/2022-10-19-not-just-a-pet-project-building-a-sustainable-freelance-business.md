    Interested in working for yourself, but not by yourself? Wondering what it's
    like building a sustainable freelance business focused on projects you care
    about? Join Johanna Ostrich and Alex Ording as they share a heartwarming
    case study: redesigning the Petfinder Foundation website with an
    all-freelancer team. 




    They’ll be discussing how they:


    * Brought together the right team for the project

    * Collaborated on research, design, and development

    * Spent multiple meetings identifying the perfect puppy photos

    * Worked closely with a nonprofit team to create a flexible and maintainable site that can grow with the organization

    * Approach building their independent businesses to be rewarding and sustainable




    By sharing their years of experience as full-time freelancers, Johanna and Alex hope to encourage others interested in working for themselves. 




    You’ll have a chance to ask them questions during the Q&A.
