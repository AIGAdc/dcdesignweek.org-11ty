    ## Description and details


    Breathe your way through blocks and resistance into your creative flow! This session will open with a calming breathing exercise, followed by writing/journaling. The centerpiece of the session is transformational breathwork, which both heals us and enhances our creativity. Once we are in a relaxed, open state, a guided meditation will stimulate our creative energy. We will then have time to focus that energy on a personal project.




    Participants are encouraged to leverage the momentum to pursue further their project following the session; you will be able to recreate most of these exercises to support your own creative practice.




    This session will be led by Jenn Koiter, a creativity coach and breathwork guide who believes that the world is better when more artists make more art — both for the artists themselves and for everyone else.
