    ## Description and Details


    Join this roundtable discussion with internet artists Trap Bob, Celine Arias, Dominick Raburn, and Nicole Ghray and moderated by Yngrid Chacon, as they discuss how the internet allows their art to reach and connect intersectional audiences.


    This conversation will cover how our panelists have used the internet to circumvent previously restrictive models that favor the privileged. The art they’ve created via the internet has provided opportunities for the connection and exposure of intersectional communities. 


    The artists will also share how the creative community can harness these new models to create a system that no longer limits intersectional communities, but encourages them instead.


    You’ll have a chance to ask experts questions during the Q&A. 


    Light refreshments will be provided.
