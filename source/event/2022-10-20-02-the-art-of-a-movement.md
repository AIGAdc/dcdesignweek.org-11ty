    ## Description and Details


    Since the beginning of time, art has served as a form of expression that has a powerful capacity to visually communicate and reveal new perspectives and narratives. Sometimes art can be open for interpretation, while other times it can be seen as more direct and explicit. Because of the naturally expressive nature of art, artists and creatives are also often activists, devoting their talents towards bigger social causes and becoming advocates for change. From fighting for AIDS awareness to protesting government censorship, artists and creatives have always been at the forefront of social change movements throughout history. Their craft emboldening the message and amplifying voices of change through visual and emotional cues.




    Join this insightful panel, featuring speakers from small to large organizations with extensive experience in the social change space. They will touch on topics that explore the unique, but integral relationship between visual communication and social change as well as how both work interchangeably to bring ideas to life by communicating directly to the public.
