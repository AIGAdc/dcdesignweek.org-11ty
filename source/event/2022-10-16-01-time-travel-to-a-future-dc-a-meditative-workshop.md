    ## Description and details


    Visions of the future often involve sweeping predictions about advances in technology or space travel. But what’s the future of our neighborhood street? Or our relationships in the community?


    This is a meditative workshop to imagine your possible future life in DC. Guided by artists and facilitators Xena Ni and Allison Press, participants will use a deck of Tarot-inspired cards designed by Xena that will transport you to the future. 


    Participants will learn how to use the cards collaboratively in small groups. One participant will deal the cards, the other will respond to the prompts on them. The cards might ask, “What do you hear?” “What does the ground feel like under your feet?” or “Who are you with?”. 


    After everyone envisons their future day, participants will sketch scenes from their session to commemorate their trip to the future.


    *Photographers and/or videographers will be documenting the event. If you wish to opt-out of being photographed, please notify the event organizers upon check-in.*


    Light refreshments will be provided.

  ## Preparation


  We recommend that attendees wear masks when not eating or drinking.


  #**COVID-19 is hard to predict: What happens if in-person events need to be canceled?**


  When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom and a refund should not be expected. If an event is canceled in its entirety, a refund will be issued. In either scenario you will be notified immediately.
