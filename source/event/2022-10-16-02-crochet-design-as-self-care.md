    ## Description and details


    Crochet artist Kristen Jeffers believes that the more people know about sustainable fiber design, the better. So even if you’ve tried and failed to crochet something before, she invites you to join her for an interactive workshop and crocheting session. 


    In the first hour, Kristen will demonstrate the process of creating a crocheted granny square. She’ll also share her own history with fiber projects, discussing how  one square can form the foundation of all kinds of fiber-related projects and launch a journey through sustainable fashion, accessories, and homewares that relieves stress and creates a sense of accomplishment.


    After the demonstration, you’ll have time to get cozy and practice making your own square with the support of Kristen and your classmates.
