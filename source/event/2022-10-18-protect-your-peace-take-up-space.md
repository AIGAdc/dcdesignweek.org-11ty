    Resilience is something of which to be proud, but let’s be real — it isn’t
    easy and can be exhausting. Certified Life Coach and Meditation/Movement
    Artist Lauren DeVera will lead us through reflective questioning,
    transformational journaling and interactive activities to help us take up
    space with confidence, all while protecting our peace! 




    Topics include living out our values, setting boundaries without guilt, and learning to listen to our higher self. We’re going to get serious but it’ll be in a cozy and safe space. 




    Every creative deserves to express themselves unapologetically — so will you join us?
