    ## Description and Details


    Does your work sound as good as it looks? Creative Director Jerome Fredericks and Senior Copywriter Leah Chamberg will lead fellow creatives on an exploration of how design and words come together to make meaningful, effective work. 


    Through discussion and sharing real-world examples, these seasoned advertising creatives will make a case for why copy is actually an integral part of the design process and deserves to be considered early on. Attendees will leave inspired to make work that is better integrated, more engaging, and sounds infinitely cooler.

    Light refreshments will be provided from Teaism, sponsored by HAWJ Studio.
