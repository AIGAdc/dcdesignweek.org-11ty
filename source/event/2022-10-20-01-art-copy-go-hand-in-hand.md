    ## Description and details


    Does your work sound as good as it looks? Creative Director Jerome Fredericks and Senior Copywriter Leah Chamberg will lead fellow creatives on an exploration of how design and words come together to make meaningful, effective work. 


    Through discussion and sharing real-world examples, these seasoned advertising creatives will make a case for why copy is actually an integral part of the design process and deserves to be considered early on. Attendees will leave inspired to make work that is better integrated, more engaging, and sounds infinitely cooler. 


    Stick around after the talk to explore the Planet Word museum.


    Light refreshments will be provided from [Teaism](https://www.teaism.com/) by our sponsor [HAWJ Studio](http://www.phimher.com/).


    *[Planet Word](https://planetwordmuseum.org/) is an immersive language experience located at the historic Franklin School in Washington, D.C. Ideal for all ages, Planet Word is a voice-activated museum (the world’s first!), and our interactive galleries and exhibits bring words and language to life in all sorts of fun ways.*

  ## In-Person Guidance


  We recommend that everyone wear a mask when they aren’t eating or drinking.


  ### COVID-19 is hard to predict: What happens if in-person events need to be canceled?


  When possible, in-person events will be moved to Zoom and a refund should not be expected. If an event is canceled in its entirety, a refund will be issued. In either scenario you will be notified immediately.
